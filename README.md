# GUI-development-using-python
In this project, I have created an Application named (TextSense App). 

-> Application Name :- TextSense App 

-> Application based :- OOPs concepts on NLP tasks

-> NLP tasks :-  Sentiment analysis, Name entity recognition, Emotion prediction. 

# Detail explanation about this project :-

# TextSense

TextSense is a Python-based GUI application that makes it easy to analyze and understand text using advance language processing techniques. 
It uses Object-Oriented-Programming (OOPs) to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience.

# API-Key

I have used (Hugging Face) API-key and models to process and getting result from NLP tasks like Sentiment analysis, Name entity recognition, emotion prediction.

# Key Features
1. User-Friendly Interfaces :- The application has a simple and easy-to-use graphical interface for interacting with its features.

2. Sentiment Analysis :- TextSense can tell you if the text is positive, negative by analyzing its sentiment.

3. Name Entity Recognition (NER) :- It identifies and highlights important names and places in the text, such as peopleâ€™s names or company names.

4. Emotion Prediction :- The app can detect and categorize emotions in the text, helping you understand how the text feels.

5. Custom (JSON-Based) Database: TextSense includes a special (JSON-based) database to store and manage data. This database is connected to the main application, making data storage and access efficient.

# Conclusion
TextSense showcases how OOPs can enhance text analysis tools, offering a practical solution for understanding and managing text data.
